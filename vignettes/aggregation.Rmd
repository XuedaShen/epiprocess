*todo*

Time stuff:

- cast to `tsibble`, with index = `time_value` and key = `geo_value`
- walk through an example with gaps, show the special gaps functions
- do some time aggregation after gap filling?
- do some time coarsening? days to weeks, or weeks to months?

Geo stuff:

- similar? but without the `tsibble` utilities, we would need to implement some 
  of this on our own and demo it in the vignette
