#' Subset of JHU daily cases and deaths from California, Florida, Texas, New York, Georgia, and Pennsylvania
#'
#' This data source of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths 
#' is based on reports made available by the Center for 
#' Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. 
#' This example data ranges from Mar 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2021, and is limited to California, Florida, Texas, New York, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.
#'
#' @format A tibble with 4026 rows and 6 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{geo_value}{the geographic value associated with each row of measurements.}
#'   \item{time_value}{the time value associated with each row of measurements.}
#'   \item{case_rate_7d_av}{7-day average signal of number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population, daily}
#'   \item{death_rate_7d_av}{7-day average signal of number of new confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 population, daily}

#' Subset of daily doctor visits and cases from California, Florida, Texas, and New York in archive format
