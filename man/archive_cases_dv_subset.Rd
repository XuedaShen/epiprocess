\title{Subset of daily doctor visits and cases from California, Florida, Texas, and New York in archive format}
\format{
An \code{epi_archive} data format. The data table DT has 160 rows and 5 columns:
\describe{
\item{geo_value}{the geographic value associated with each row of measurements.}
\item{time_value}{the time value associated with each row of measurements.}
\item{version}{the time value specifying the version for each row of measurements. }
\item{percent_cli}{percentage of doctorâ€™s visits with CLI (COVID-like illness) computed from medical insurance claims}
\item{case_rate_7d_av}{7-day average signal of number of new confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 population, daily}
}

Modifications:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/doctor-visits.html}{From the COVIDcast Epidata Doctor Visits API}: These signals are taken directly from the JHU CSSE \href{https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19}{COVID-19 GitHub repository} without changes. The 7-day average signals are computed by Delphi by calculating moving averages of the preceding 7 days, so the signal for June 7 is the average of the underlying data for June 1 through 7, inclusive.
\item Furthermore, the data has been limited to a very small number of rows, the signal names slightly altered, and formatted into a tibble.
